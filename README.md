# sample-python-pptx


As shown, all the `Lions` are getting replaced, which leaves only one animal, rather than 3 different animals in the `edited.pptx` file. This seems to me to be because the `Lions` all have the same `rId2`. It would be nice to identify them by some other `id` and use this. Or, I might need to use a completely different approach?
